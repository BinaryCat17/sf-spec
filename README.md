# SionFlow

**SionFlow** is a high-performance, data-oriented computation engine designed for real-time applications, games, and creative tools. It separates the **definition** of logic (Node Graphs) from its **execution** (Virtual Machine), using a Columnar Memory Model (SoA) for maximum cache efficiency and future GPU scalability.

> **Status:** Active Development (Core VM & Compiler Phase).

## Key Features

*   **Data-Oriented Architecture:** Data is stored in Structure-of-Arrays (Columns), optimized for SIMD and GPU transfer.
*   **Modular Design:** Decoupled modules for Compiler, VM, and Backends.
*   **Optimizing Compiler:** Multi-pass pipeline featuring instruction fusion (FMA), advanced lowering (MEAN decomposition), and liveness-based register allocation (Buffer Aliasing).
*   **Portable C11:** Written in strict C11, no heavy dependencies (only `cJSON` for the compiler).
*   **Safety & Abstraction:** Accessor API with bounds checking protects memory integrity while keeping the backend agnostic to storage location (RAM/VRAM).
*   **Cross-Platform:** Built with CMake, supports Linux and Windows via presets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   CMake (3.25+)
*   C Compiler (GCC/Clang/MSVC)
*   [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) (for dependency management)

### Build Instructions

1.  **Configure vcpkg:**
    Ensure `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable is set.

2.  **Build (Linux):**
    ```bash
    cmake --preset x64-debug-linux
    cmake --build out/build/x64-debug-linux
    ```

3.  **Build (Windows):**
    Open the folder in Visual Studio or use:
    ```cmd
    cmake --preset x64-debug-win
    cmake --build out/build/x64-debug-win
    ```

## Usage

SionFlow comes with a CLI tool `sf-runner` for text output and `sf-window` for real-time visual output (SDL2).

**Run a test graph (CLI):**
```bash
./out/build/x64-debug-linux/sf-runner assets/projects/inventory/inventory.json
```

**Run a Pixel Math demo (Visual):**
```bash
./out/build/x64-debug-linux/apps/sf-window/sf-window assets/projects/sdf_button/sdf_button.mfapp
```

**Output:**
```
SionFlow Tensor Runner. Loading: assets/projects/inventory/inventory.json
Program: 12 tensors, 6 insts
...
  [11] Shape: [5] F32: {0.00, 1200.00, 1440.00, 0.00, 12000.00}
```
